## Rebecca Cleveland Stout

I am a PhD student in the Earth and Space Sciences Department at the University of Washington, advised by Gerard Roe. I am interested in paleoclimate, climate variability, and sea level. I graduated from Harvard University in 2019, where I worked with Jerry Mitrovica, Peter Huybers, and Tamara Pico (now a professor at UC Santa Cruz).
