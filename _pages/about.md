Welcome! I am currently a research assistant in Mike Lamb's lab at Caltech, and am an incoming first-year PhD student in the Earth & Space Sciences department at the University of Washington. I am interested in paleoclimate, climate variability, sea level, and solid Earth deformation. My research uses simple modeling to investigate past large-scale changes in the climate system, with the goal of understanding mechanisms of climate change to help improve projections of future warming.
